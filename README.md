# dog_breed_classifier

## Project Motivation

Build a deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify dog breeds based on image recognition.
Evaluate and compare 2 different approaches:
* Build the CNN from scratch
* Use a transfer-learning based approach
* The project has also be published on https://medium.com/@migueltya/building-a-convolutional-neural-network-based-dog-breed-classifier-8b4bcb36a036

# Installations

* No local installation is necessary
* This repository contains a jupyter notebook "dog_breed_classifier.ipynb" comparing the two approaches to building the CNN based dog breed classifier. 

##  System Requirements: 
* Python 3.x
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Jupyter

# Intended Usage

* This is a show case and meant for educational purposes and reading through implementation along the notebook
